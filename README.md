# Life Expectancy and GDP Capstone

For this project, you will act as a data researcher for the World Health Organisation. You will be helping them analyse data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organisation and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

During this project, you will analyse, prepare, and plot data, and seek to answer questions in a meaningful way.

After you perform analysis, you'll be creating a blog post to share your findings on their website.
